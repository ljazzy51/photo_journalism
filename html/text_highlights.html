              <h1>Community Spaces</h1>
              <p>
                    I wanted to explore the aspects of community and queer culture that happens outside of the clubs and bars. The first place I knew I wanted to go to 
                    explore this idea was Bluestockings Bookstore. I have always loved going there and I knew there was a lot more to the store than what was on the 
                    surface.

                <p class="content_article">
                    I walked into Bluestockings Bookstore. There is a rainbow pride flag hanging in the window, calling me in. 
                    Bluestockings is one of the few queer and inclusive spaces in New York that operates in the daytime. So much of queer culture in New York centers around
                    nightlife and mainstream history. When people think about queer culture in New York, people think about gay bars, burlesque clubs, popularized history such
                    as the Stonewall Riots. When the average person thinks about New York queer culture and communities rarely do people think about the piers or the volunteer and
                    community based programs. These programs cater to both queer youths and adults, alike.
                </p>
                <p class="content_article">
                    These programs assure the wellbeing and progression of both personal and day to day rights of the “average queer person” in New York.
                    When I talk about the “average queer person”, I do not mean the bisexual nineteen year old NYU student who’s tuition is paid by their daddy’s trust fund.
                    When I say the “average queer person”, I am talking about the lesbian woman that is on their way to work in the morning. I am talking about the fifteen year
                    old who is “only out at school” when they go about their day. I am talking about the sixty year old woman who finally has an understanding of what it means
                    to be Transgender. I am talking about the underrepresented person. The queer person that is not the standard definition of sex or the typical image of sexuality.
                    The queer sex worker who is trying to pay his way through college. The drag queen who is a barista for their day job. Those are the people that represent the
                    queer community during the day. The glitz and glam of the queer nightlife is dazzling, but the heart and soul of the queer community comes down to what happens
                    during the day.
                </p>
                <p class="content_article">
                    Community based programs such as Bluestockings or simply public spaces that have daytime significance to the queer community such as: the piers, bookshops,
                    community centers, libraries, or health centers. These types of spaces are essential to queer communities, especially in New York. Don't get me wrong, I love
                    my fair share of gay bars and queer nightlife. However, the places that I have both learned the most about myself and the places that I have felt most accepted
                    have been queer spaces that I have only frequented during the daytime. 
                </p>
                <p class="content_article">
                    While the pride flag in the window drew me in, the ambiance is what kept me engaged. Bluestockings is a community and volunteer owned bookstore that prioritizes
                    the well being of marginalized communities as well as the community as a whole. They have community outreach programs, mutual aid, drives and fundraisers, as
                    well as resources and literature on underrepresented topics like queer experiences.

                <h2 class="content_title">My Name is Red</h2>
                <p class="content_article">
                    When I walked into the store, one of the many volunteers who was working that day said “Hey! Welcome to Bluestockings.” I walked over to them and asked if they
                    had a moment to chat. “My shift ends soon but I definitely have a moment,” they said. “I am doing a school project and I was just hoping to ask you about the
                    shop itself as well as the greater community impact,” I responded. “How long have you been volunteering here?” “This is my second year.”
                    “What is your favorite part of Bluestockings?” “For me, this store has provided a community unlike any other that I have been a part of. I love the accessible
                    literature and the intersectionality that these writings contain. I am the zine coordinator so obviously, I love those too.” “How have you noticed the store
                    change in relation to the neighborhood?” “Well, there has been a lot of change even throughout the short time I have been working here. Because this bookstore
                    has such a unique mission of radical feminism and  politics, there are actually a lot of global visitors who come to see our collection. Also because we are
                    located in the Lower East Side, which is close to Chinatown, we have a lot of Asian identifying people come to the store.” “Has the store received backlash due
                    to its radical mission or is the community typically pretty accepting?” “There have been a couple scary moments with ‘alt-right’ protesters who have come to
                    the store and really made issues. However,  those protesters were not from the Lower East Side and the community really rallied behind us in support.
                    In addition, when the community has struggled, particularly after 9/11 when there was a surge of xenophobia surrounding the muslim parts of the neighborhood,
                    we rallied behind them in solidarity. As we love the community, the community loves us back.” “Thank you so much for your time. My name is Lilyanne by the way.”
                    “No! Thank you! My name is Red.”

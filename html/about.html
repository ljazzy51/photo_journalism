                <h2 class="content_title">Growing Up</h2>
                <p class="content_article">
                    I grew up in a quiet suburban town. I went to church on Sundays, church youth group on Wednesdays, and sports after school. 
                    Whatever "free time" I had was spent at school, work, volunteering, or doing homework.
                    I was expected to do well in school but better in life.
                    The wildest thing that happened on a weeknight was sitting in the CVS parking lot talking about essentially made up drama.
                    It wouldn't matter if I was getting straight As or B+s in school.
                    If I was not supporting my community, I would not be judged as a good person.
                    Unfortunately, the standards for "good person" for my parents were very different from what I thought of for myself.
                    While I placed priorities on society and community based programs, I was always told that I should "invest in my future"
                    I was told that I should care about my future and my career.
                    I was also told that if I came out or showed any of my personality that I would either get fired or never get hired in the first place. 
                    I was told that my queer identity would be the final and overriding card of my career.
                    I would never hide my identity again because I refuse to send the message that queer people do not have the same options for careers that queer people do

                <h2 class="content_title">Queer Life</h2>
                <p class="content_article">
                    When I was 12, my mom read my texts with the first girlfriend I ever had. It turned into a whole thing. 
                    The only thing I gained from those years was that I needed to be sneakier and that I needed to give up everything I did that could connect me to queer culture.
                    I hid a crucial part of my identity for 5 years. When I was in Junior year of high school I got the opportunity of a lifetime. I got into a social activism 
                    program that would allow me to spend my entire Junior year in New York City. When I got here my small suburban world exploded and I was able to express 
                    a whole new side of myself. I got to experience parts of queer culture I didnt even know existed. Unfortunately, my Junior year happened to be in 2020. 
                    Due to the pandemic, I had to cut my experience short return to my small suburban world. The difference when I returned was that I was not willing to give up
                    everything I experienced in New York, everything I got to be. This exposure to New York queer culture allowed me to find myself and it meant everything to me. 
                    I owe who I am now to queer culture and I know I am not alone in that.
